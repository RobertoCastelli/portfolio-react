    <meta name="description" property="og:description" content="Hi, my name is Roberto and I'm a Project Manager. Since I was a youngster I had a passion for programming languages. Recently I decided to bring into fruition my avid interest in this field to enhance my career, putting every possible effort to achieve this goal and pursue this path. In the meantime, I'm writing a blog named 'Diary of an impostor' to keep track of my progress, in the hopes of helping other people to share this adventure." />

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
