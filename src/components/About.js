            <p>Hi, my name is Roberto and I'm a Project Manager. Since I was a youngster I had a passion for programming languages. Recently I decided to bring into fruition my avid interest in this field to enhance my career, putting every possible effort to achieve this goal and pursue this path. In the meantime, I'm writing a blog named "Diary of an impostor" to keep track of my progress, in the hopes of helping other people to share this adventure.</p>
